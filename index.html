<B>Audio Player</B>
<BR/>
This is a weekend project to engage with a GUI Java library. I built the backend quickly then spent time designing buttons to skip songs, play songs or pause the music. The software plays the tracks inside the music directory. I am looking forward to add playlists and other cool features.

<B>Eshu</B>
<BR/>
Eshu is a language detector. It uses supervised leaning to guess more accurately the language of the text given by the user. It will take your sentence/name/text as input and tell you the language in which it was written. It is named after an African god in the Yoruba culture who knows all the languages on the surface of the earth and serve as a messenger between gods and humen. The software was developed with python IDLE using the thousands of book put available by the gutenberg project.
For more info on the Gutenberg project consult <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org/</a> In this project we only used 20 books per language to train how learning algorithm.
