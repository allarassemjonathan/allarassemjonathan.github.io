<H3>BLOCKCHAIN OPTIMIST:</H3>
I am fascinated by the possibilities given by a decentralized system like the blockchain. I truly think that it is going to take over and change the future like nothing before. I think that Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin did not realize how deep it could impact society. Even though my knowledge is limited, I would like to learn more about smart contracts and ways in which we can implement trustless systems for the better of the human race.

<H3>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING PROJECTS:</H3>
<B>Thannos Servant (chat bot)</B>
<BR/>
This is a python chatbot named Thannos built during 2-3 weeks. The bot can do multiple things:
<ol>
	<li>Warn people when they break chat rules</li>
	<li>Email people with gmail accounts</li>
	<li>DM people in the discord app</li>
	<li>Customize profile picture and generate edited photos</li>
	<li>Search information on wikipedia with the Wikipedia API</li>
	<li>Play/pause music during a chat call</li>
	<li>Get information about the server</li>
	<li>Generate plausible human text</li>
	<li>Find the language of a user input</li>
</ol>
And many other things.
This was a project built to engage with python programming language and the DISCORD library.

<B>Eshu Language Detector</B>
<BR/>
Eshu is a language detector. It uses supervised leaning to guess more accurately the language of the text given by the user. It will take your sentence/name/text as input and tell you the language in which it was written. It is named after an African god in the Yoruba culture who knows all the languages on the surface of the earth and serve as a messenger between gods and humans. The software was developed with python IDLE using the thousands of book put available by the gutenberg project.
For more info on the Gutenberg project consult <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org/</a> In this project we only used 20 books per language to train our learning algorithm. 
It supports French, English, Spanish and Germans.

<B>Text Generator | Research project</B>
<BR/>
I developed an application (in Python) that generates plausible human text, using Markov chains models and n-grams. The
algorithm used was trained on books like Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes accessed in txt files through datasets like the Gutenberg 
project. The version below used basic Markov chains to generate words. A problem here is that as the volume of data increases, it is more difficult to generate plausible text. A solution could be to add a second order markov chain or bigrams.

<H3>JAVA PROJECTS:</H3>
<B>Audio Player</B>
<BR/>
This is a weekend project to engage with a GUI Java library. I built the backend quickly then spent time designing buttons to skip songs, play songs or pause the music. The software plays the tracks inside the music directory. I am looking forward to add playlists and other cool features.

<B>Tic Tac Toe</B>
<BR/>
This is a console based game. It is multiplayer. You can play against yourself. I am working on adding an AI mode with multiple level of difficulty using the minimaxi algorithm.

<B>Wikipedia API</B>
<BR/>
The wikipedia API is a Java api to query more easily the wikipedia website. The goal of this library is to give power to java developer by replacing complex JSOUP statement by straighforward JAVA code. My goal is really to simplify things for Java developer. This is an open source project. People can just download the jar file of the new version and automatically start to use it.

<H3>WEB DEVELOPMENT:</H3>
<B>Forum</B>
<BR/>
I volunteered as a web developer the summer after I graduated from highschool. With a team of 2 other web developer we built a small social media for our youth community. I was in charge of the profile pages. We were using the Laravel framework and languages like MySql, HTML, CSS and PHP to develop our web application.

<B>Portfolio</B>
<BR/>
I designed and implemented my website. I wanted it to be simple and information to be accessible easily. It was not a design project so I kept it as simple as possible.
